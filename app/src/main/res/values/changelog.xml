        \nâ€¢ <b>17 new currencies!</b> That\'s now 50 in total. ðŸ¥³ Too many to name them all. However, a lot of popular vacation destinations in the middle east and the caribbean are now included: UAE, Qatar, Barbados, Bahamas, Cuba, â€¦
        \nâ€¢ To stay on top of all those new choices, a <b>search</b> is now available in the currency picker.
        \nâ€¢ The picker now also shows a currency\'s <b>full name</b>, not only its code. An awesome addition, in combination with the search. Try it out!
