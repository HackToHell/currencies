    <string name="changelog" translatable="false"><b>1.4.1</b>
        \nâ€¢ UI improvements
        \n
        \n<b>1.4.0</b>
        \nâ€¢ It is now possible to manually refresh the rates. Check it out in the overflow menu.
        \nâ€¢ Performance improvements
        \n
        \n<b>1.3.0</b>
        \nâ€¢ <b>So many more currencies! Over 160 in total, now!!</b> That\'s because Currencies switched to a different API. The old one (exchangeratesapi.io) changed to a subscription model without any prior warning. NOT GOOD! Our new provider will be exchangerate.host.
        \nâ€¢ That also means, that the last couple of days, the exchange rates couldn\'t be refreshed. That\'s fixed now, of course.
        \nâ€¢ Also, the refresh process itself got improved, so at least next time something like that happens, you\'ll get a notice.
        \nâ€¢ Small UI improvements
        \n
        \n<b>1.2.0</b>
        \nâ€¢ <b>17 new currencies!</b> That\'s now 50 in total. ðŸ¥³ Too many to name them all. However, a lot of popular vacation destinations in the middle east and the caribbean are now included: UAE, Qatar, Barbados, Bahamas, Cuba, â€¦
        \nâ€¢ To stay on top of all those new choices, a <b>search</b> is now available in the currency picker.
        \nâ€¢ The picker now also shows a currency\'s <b>full name</b>, not only its code. An awesome addition, in combination with the search. Try it out!
        \n
