        \n<b>1.3.0</b>
        \n⸻
        \n<li><b>So many more currencies! Over 160 in total, now!!</b> That\'s because Currencies switched to a different API. The old one (exchangeratesapi.io) changed to a subscription model without any prior warning. NOT GOOD! Our new provider will be exchangerate.host.</li>
        \n<li>That also means, that the last couple of days, the exchange rates couldn\'t be refreshed. That\'s fixed now, of course.</li>
        \n<li>Also, the refresh process itself got improved, so at least next time something like that happens, you\'ll get a notice.</li>

        \n<li>To stay on top of all those new choices, a <b>search</b> is now available in the currency picker.</li>
        \n<li>The picker now also shows a currency\'s <b>full name</b>, not only its code. An awesome addition, in combination with the search. Try it out!</li>
