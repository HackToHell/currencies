* [add] copy function:  
Allows for copying the current values. Probably best solution: Longclick on a value copies this specific value. So basically a "hidden" feature. Make a Toast/Snackbar notify the user about what just happened.

* [add] "fee"-calculator:  
Some credit card companies charge a percentual fee when paying in a foreign currency. As this app is inteded to be used on vacation, it could be quite useful to inclue an option to add this fee to the calculation.
